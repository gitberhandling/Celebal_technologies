Conclusion of the EDA

1.Gender and Survival:
Women had a significantly higher survival rate than men, likely due to the "women and children first" protocol.

2.Social Class Matters:
First-class passengers had better survival chances than those in second or third class, indicating that wealth and status played a major role.

3.Age Factor:
Children and younger passengers were more likely to survive compared to older individuals.

4.Family Influence:
Passengers traveling with family members had a slightly better chance of survival than those traveling alone.

5.Embarkation and Fare:
The port of embarkation and the fare amount provided some clues about survival rates, but their impact was less significant than gender or class.

6.Missing Data:
Certain columns, such as Cabin, contained many missing values and may not be very useful without data cleaning or imputation.
